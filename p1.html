<p>AI has been used to optimize traffic management applications, which in turn reduces wait times, energy use, and emissions by as much as 25 percent. In the future, fully autonomous cars will be developed. It's thought that AI in transport will provide safe, efficient, and reliable transportation, whilst also minimizing its environmental and societal impacts. The main issue with developing this AI is the fact that transportation systems are inherently complex, and involve a very large number of components and different parties, with each having different and often conflicting objectives. Due to the high degree of complexity, often it's not possible to train an AI algorithm in a real-world driving environment. To overcome the challenge of training neural networks for automated driving, methodologies based on virtual development resp. testing toolchains have been proposed</p>
<p>There are more than 30 companies harnessing AI in the creation of self-driving cars. Some of them include Tesla, Google, and Apple</p>
<p>Examples of the uses of AI in cars available to the public:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Self-parking, used in such cars as the BMW i3, Jeep Cherokee Limited, and the Tesla Model S, among others</li>
    <li>Advanced cruise control</li>
    <li>Tesla's Autopilot, as seen in the video below:</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a reason why driverless cars aren't currently widespread:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
    To make a driverless automobile, engineers must program it to handle high-risk situations. These situations could include a head-on
    collision with pedestrians. The car's main goal should be to make a decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrians and saving the
    passengers in the car. But there is a possibility the car would need to make a decision that would put someone in danger. In other
    words, the car would need to decide to save the pedestrians or the passengers. The programming of the car in these situations is
    crucial to a successful driverless automobile.
</blockquote>
<p>In 2018 (a decently long while ago in technological terms), the BBC published an interesting <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45991093"> article</a> about this moral conondrum.</p>

Airbus, the leading aircraft manufacturer, is implementing AI applications to improve the reliability of their aircraft maintenance process. Skywise, a Cloud-based application helps in an efficient data storage. The fleet collects and records a vast amount of data in real-time, processes it and stores it in the Cloud server. Predictive Analytics and AI develop a systematic approach for the airlines company to decide an effective process for aircraft maintenance.

The Transport Security Administration, US, implemented AI to detect potential threats at major airports (John F Kennedy, Phoenix, and Los Angeles airports). Similarly, the Hartsfield-Jackson airport plans to launch the countryâ€™s first biometric terminal. AI-enabled tools will speed up the passenger identification process. Security scanners, Machine Learning tools, and Biometric Identification will ease operations at the ground staff level, as seen below:
