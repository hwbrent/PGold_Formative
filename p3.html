<h1> Artificial Intelligence History and Progress </h1>
<h2>
    History of Artificial Intelligence
</h2>
<p>
    The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.</p>
<p> The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College during the summer of 1956. Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true. </p>
<p>Eventually, it became obvious that they had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. In 1973, in response to the criticism from James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from congress, the U.S. and British Governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial intelligence, and the difficult years that followed would later be known as an "AI winter". Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government inspired governments and industry to provide AI with billions of dollars, but by the late 80s the investors became disillusioned and withdrew funding again. </p>

<h2>
    Artificial Intelligence growth
</h2>
<p> Artificial intelligence applications have been used in a wide range of fields including medical diagnosis, stock trading, robot control, law, scientific discovery, video games, and toys. However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.Many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry. In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI technology became widely used as elements of larger systems, but the field is rarely credited for these successes. </p>
<h3> Kaplan and Haenlein structure artificial intelligence along three evolutionary stages:
</h3>
<p>
    <ol>
    <li> artificial narrow intelligence -- applying AI only to specific tasks </li>
    <li> <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence "> artificial general intelligence </a> -- applying AI to several areas and able to autonomously solve problems they were never even designed for</li>
<li><a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence"> artificial super intelligence </a> -- applying AI to any area capable of scientific creativity, social skills, and general wisdom</li>

</ol>
</p>
<p>
    To allow comparison with human performance, artificial intelligence can be evaluated on constrained and well-defined problems. Such tests have been termed subject matter expert Turing tests. Also, smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.
